## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of how I want the project to be done. My algorithm skills are solid so I think the set up, get, and posting data will be simple.

### Weaknesses:
I am not very good with CSS and that will take the most amount of time other than polishing things out. 

### Opportunities:

This will help me learn about how to do get, post, and setting. This will also look good on my projects as an e-commerce website.

### Threats:
Debugging and finishing on time is going to be a struggle for me If I cannot get things to work properly.
